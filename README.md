## :information_source: About me
I am a hobbyist developer from :de: Germany who likes **procedural :elephant: PHP coding**, while not doing this for a living.

My interests are the development of [small tools, little helpers and various websites](https://RundesBalli.com/projects) and the management of the [Bratwurst-ADSB](https://info.bratwurst.network) community project.

## :scroll: Projects
I would also like to direct you to my website ðŸŽ± [RundesBalli.com](https://RundesBalli.com), where you can find an overview of all my projects and the links to the respective repositories and/or websites.

You can contact me in German :de: (native language) or English :uk:.

I will ignore automated emails and I am not interested in studies or full-time job offers.
