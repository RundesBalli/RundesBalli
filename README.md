## :information_source: About me
I am a hobbyist developer from :de: Germany who likes **procedural :elephant: PHP coding**, without doing this for a living.  

## :scroll: Projects
Most of my public projects are **small tools**, **scripts**, **boilerplates** and **websites**, which are commented, documented and coded in :uk: English. Some of them are for use with the German imageboard [pr0gramm.com](https://pr0gramm.com) and because of the majority of the target group of pr0gramm is German-speaking, the projects are commented and documented in :de: German.
