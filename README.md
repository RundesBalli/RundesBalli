## :information_source: About me
I am a hobbyist developer from :de: Germany who likes **procedural :elephant: PHP coding**, while not doing this for a living.

My interests are the development of [small tools, little helpers and various websites](https://RundesBalli.com/projects).

Furthermore I am the project lead and main programmer of the [Bratwurst-ADSB](https://info.bratwurst.network) community project.
